Gets all the required SteamGuard files for Steam's account protection system

In order to log into a Steam account without having to wait for 7 days in order to preform basic actions such as trading, 
just copy the SteamGuard files from a computer which has already waited 7 days.

Just run this application on the computer which has already waited and it will Zip them up for you.
No need to wait 7 days anymore when switching computers.

And hey, maybe you could do some malicious stuff as well, who knows.
