In order to log into a Steam account from a new device without having to wait for 7 days in order to preform basic actions such as trading, 
just copy the SteamGuard files from a computer which has already waited 7 days.

Just run this application on the computer which has already waited and it will Zip them up for you.
No need to wait 7 days anymore when switching computers.

And hey, maybe you could do some malicious stuff as well, who knows.

Download the source and compile it, or download the program from the release thread
